    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <p>IoT applications are a way of programming computer to communication to each other to and limit the human interaction, 
      this is the best way to increase the efficiency of any system. This can be done by adding different sensors and other devices that will 
      collect data from the surrounding environment, this data can then be processed and turned into useful information that can then change the 
      way the system runs. A example of this would be a buildings lights turning on as it starts to get dark outside.  </p>
    <h1>Smart building</h1>
    <p>A smart building would have a number of different sensors that help improve the efficiency of the building, while remvoing the human 
      error. This is a fanstic way of implementing IoT into a work environment. To implement these functions into a bulding theres needs 
      to be ways of capturing, storing and processing information. Using a AI to help process this information could also allow the system 
      to learn from behavior patterns and make the system even more efficient.
    </p>
    <h1>IoT Intefaces</h1>
    <p>A interface for a smart bulding would need to have ways of monitoring every room and hallway in the building, be able to know 
      how many people are in each room (this could be done through the use of cameras), what the temperature is in each room, and the 
      current weather so it can adjust the heating and cooler to keep the temperature the same accross the building, be able to 
      limit who has access to the interface to make changes accross the bulding and be preetive in making changes, such as if the sun 
      starts to set turn on the lights, or change the level of brightness to slow increase as it gets darker, and then limit the 
      level of bluelight the later into the night it gets.</p>
